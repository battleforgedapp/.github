## Welcome to Battleforged.

> Battleforged is a web based army pointing tool for Games Workshop's Warhammer 40k tabletop game. 

Please hang tight as I get the repositories setup. This is a project I'm doing in my spare time to learn frameworks and clean architecture in microservices. It's completley open source and will be available as I build it.
